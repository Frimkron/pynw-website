Python Northwest Website
========================

A website for _Python Northwest_, a usergroup for the Python programming
language based in Manchester, UK. We meet on the _third Thursday_ of every 
month, 7pm at Mad Lab on Edge Street.

This project uses __Django__ and requires __Python 3__. You will need to 
create a `settings_secret.py` file in the `PYNWapp` directory. See 
`settings_secret.py.template` for an example.
